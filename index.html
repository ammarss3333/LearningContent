      TailwindCSS is loaded via the play CDN to keep the frontâ€‘end fully static.
      When the page loads in a modern browser with an internet connection the
      CDN downloads the framework.  We use the play CDN here so we can
      customise colours through the `tailwind.config` object below.  The
      play CDN logs a warning in production but works fine for a small
      project like this.  To optimise for production you can compile a
      custom CSS file locally with Tailwind CLI instead.

      Load React, ReactDOM, React Router and Framer Motion from jsDelivr instead of unpkg.
      Unpkg redirects versionless requests to the latest minor version and does not set
      CORS headers, which causes browsers to block the request when served from GitHub Pages.
      jsDelivr hosts the UMD builds and sets permissive CORS headers.  Pin the versions
      to avoid unexpected upgrades.
